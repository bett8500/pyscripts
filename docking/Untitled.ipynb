    "=== Obtaining Ligand Data Files ===\n",
    "Chemical formats are painfully unstandardized. Depending on your application and\n",
    "resources, there are numerous options (not discussed here) for obtaining data\n",
    "files for ligand compounds. When seeking chemical data files, numerous chemical\n",
    "databases exist online (Pubchem etc.) as do tools for creating your compound.\n",
    "The specific properties (partial charge, bond lengths and angles, etc.) may be\n",
    "refined using other software*. Depending on the ligand, multiple conformers may\n",
    "be necessary. Different software produce different chemical formats.\n",
    "Conversion tools, such as babel or openbabel (openbabel.org), are required to\n",
    "convert your file into the .mdl format for usage in the PyRosetta database. If\n",
    "starting from an RCSB crystal structure, you can use PyMOL's \"Save Molecule\"\n",
    "feature to produce an .mdl file of a ligand (the file extension appears as\n",
    "\".mol\"). Molecular Networks (http://www.molecular-networks.com/) offers a free\n",
    "online demo for chemical file format conversion\n",
    "(http://www.molecular-networks.com/online_demos/convert_demo).\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Converting to Params Files ===\n",
    "An additional script (and other necessary scripts) are provided for converting\n",
    "an .mdl file to a .params file (required for the PyRosetta database) and .pdb\n",
    "files. Execute this script from the commandline providing the .mdl file as the\n",
    "first argument and the ResidueType name as option \"-n\". For the .mdl file\n",
    "provided with this script, the example commandline call would be:\n",
    "\n",
    ">python molfile_to_params.py ATP.mdl -n ATP\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will produce two files, \"ATP.params\" and \"ATP_0001.pdb\". The\n",
    ".params file is necessary for the PyRosetta database, it defines the \"ATP\"\n",
    "ResidueType. The .pdb file is produced for grafting the ligand into a PDB file\n",
    "(the next step).\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Preparing Ligand PDB Files ===\n",
    "Now that the ResidueType is defined, the PDB file for ligand interface\n",
    "prediction can be made. If the PDB file already has the ligand present, ensure\n",
    "that its ResisueType column (PDB file format) is set to the ligand ResidueType\n",
    "(\"ATP\" for the example case). It is common practice to rename the chain to \"X\".\n",
    "If the ligand is not already present in the PDB file, insert in manually\n",
    "(using PyMOL, grep, awk, Python, Biopython, or whatever technique you prefer).\n",
    "The script modfile_to_params.py provides a sample .pdb file for this purpose.\n",
    "Ensure that the final PDB file has the proper ResidueType definition and chain\n",
    "ID. As with DNA-protein PDB files, the ligand chain should be last**.\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Loading a Ligand PDB File into PyRosetta ===\n",
    "\n",
    "== Method 1: Loading the .params file into the Pose ==\n",
    "Inside the relevant script or interpreter, use the modifiable_residue_type_set_for_conf()\n",
    "method of the pose's Conformation object (pose.conformation()) to first get a copy of the\n",
    "Pose-specific ResidueTypeSet. You can then load one or more .params files into this\n",

    "using the Pose-specific ResidueTypeSet to define any unknown residues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is preferred when the ligand is transitory (default). Permanently\n",

    "PyRosetta if too many are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "== Method 2: Permanently by altering the PyRosetta database ==\n",
    "Place (or copy) the new .params file somewhere in the PyRosetta fullatom\n",

    "\n",
    "/minirosetta_database/chemical/residue_type_sets/fa_standard/residue_types\n",
